# Delyrium (CRA)

![CI/CD](https://github.com/p3tr0sh/delyrium-cra/workflows/CI/CD/badge.svg)

This project is the [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) version of [Delyrium](https://github.com/p3tr0sh/delyrium).
Once the migration from the static site generator Gatsby is done, it will replace the old version.

This project generates an interactive website from music sheets noted in the ChordPro format.
The music sheets are loaded from an external cloud application.
The sheets can be transposed to any key.
